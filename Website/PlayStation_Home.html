<h2 style="text-align:center;">PlayStation</h2>
The PlayStation is a video game console originally released in Japan in December 1994 by <i>Sony Interactive Entertainment</i> (a division of Sony) and then released worldwide the following 
year. The creation of the PlayStation One signalled Sony’s rise to power in the video game world. Also known as the PS, the PlayStation used compact discs (CDs), heralding the video game industry’s move away from cartridges.
<p></P>
Recognized as a global leader in interactive and digital entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) is responsible for the PlayStation brand and family of products and services. 
PlayStation has delivered innovation to the market since the launch of the original PlayStation in Japan in 1994. The PlayStation brand consists of four home video game consoles (with

<h2 style="text-align:center;">History</h2>
PlayStation was the brainchild of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kutaragi" onmouseover="this.className='rollover' " onmouseout="this.className=' ' ">Ken Kutaragi</a>, a Sony executive who managed one of the company's hardware engineering divisions and was later dubbed "The Father of the PlayStation".
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-iJTq9W3Lg"><img src="Graphics/ken kutaragi.jpg" title="Ken Kutaragi, 'The Father of the PlayStation'" alt="Ken Kutaragi" style="float:right;width:300px;height:250px;border:4px solid white;"></img></a>
<p></P>
The console's origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom. Although Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive, that incorporated Green Book technology or CD-i, called "Play Station" at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991. However, a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies. The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.
<p></P>
At that time, negotiations were still on-going between Nintendo and Sony, with Nintendo offering Sony a "non-gaming role" regarding their new partnership with Philips. This proposal 
was swiftly rejected by Kutaragi who was facing increasing criticism over his work with regard to entering the video game industry from within Sony. Negotiations officially ended in 
May 1992 and in order to decide the fate of the PlayStation project, a meeting was held in June 1992, consisting of Sony President Ohga, PlayStation Head Kutaragi and several senior 
members of Sony's board. At the meeting, Kutaragi unveiled a proprietary CD-ROM-based system he had been working on which involved playing video games with 3D graphics to the board. 
Eventually, Sony President Ohga decided to retain the project after being reminded by Kutaragi of the humiliation he suffered from Nintendo. Nevertheless, due to strong opposition 
from a majority present at the meeting as well as widespread internal opposition to the project by the older generation of Sony executives, Kutaragi and his team had to be shifted 
from Sony's headquarters to Sony Music, a completely separate financial entity owned by Sony, so as to retain the project and maintain relationships with Philips for the MMCD development project (which helped lead to the creation of the DVD).
<p></P>
According to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. 
Eventually, after witnessing the success of Sega's Virtua Fighter in Japanese arcades, that Sony realized "the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.
<p></P>
The original PlayStation continued production until March 2005, when it was eclipsed by the next generation of 64-bit consoles, including Sony’s own PlayStation 2 (PS2; introduced in 
the early 2000s). The PS2 offered an ability to play over the Internet, which, combined with the most extensive line of games ever marketed for a console, led to its sales dominance 
over its 64-bit rivals Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube. In fact, PlayStation 2 went on to ship 100 million units faster than any of its predecessors or contemporaries. However, 
the next instalment of the PlayStation consoles, the PlayStation 3 (released in 2006 and 2007), did not enjoy the same initial success as the earlier incarnations of the console, 
with ongoing competition from the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii.
<p></P>
In 2013 Sony released the PlayStation 4 (PS4), a next-generation console designed to compete with the Xbox One. Critics and players embraced the new platform, which boasted outstanding 
graphics and a smooth online multiplayer experience. The PS4 also doubled as a Blu-ray player and a media streaming device, and Sony’s PlayStation Now subscription service provided 
access to hundreds of current and legacy games. Sony entered the expanding virtual reality (VR) market with the release of the PlayStation VR (PS VR) in October 2016. The PS VR system 
included a PS4 as well as a VR headset and controllers. The PS VR was priced well below similar PC-based VR systems, leading many to assume that it would make significant inroads into 
the market, but sluggish sales across the VR industry led analysts to drastically downgrade their expectations.

<h2 style="text-align:center">PlayStation Logo</h2>
The PlayStation logo was designed by Manabu Sakamoto. He wanted the logo to capture the 3D support of the console, but instead of just adding apparent depth to the letter’s "P" and "S", 
he created an optical illusion that suggested the letters in depth of space. Sakamoto also stuck with four bright principle colours, red, yellow, green, and blue, only having to tune 
the green colour for better harmony across the logo. Sakamoto also designed the black and white logo based on the same design, reserved for times where colours could not be used.</br>
