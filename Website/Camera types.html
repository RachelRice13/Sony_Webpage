Sony's engineers have always collaborated with cinematographers retaining the quality and durability for harsh shooting environments, while dramatically reducing 
manufacturing resource use. This includes reduction of raw material consumption through lighter and more compact products to lessen the impact on the earth. They create 
a 20% lighter, more compact, 40% smaller camera without reducing performance and reconsidering the materials use. Therefore, by reconsidering the structure, improvements 
were made on overall heat emission. The two internal turrets for ND filters allow eight steps of servo ND exposure control It offers unmatched shooting flexibility also 
helps to reduce the outer circumference.
