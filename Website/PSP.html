<h2 style="text-align:center;">PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 Models</h2>

The PSP-2000 (also known as the Slim & Lite in PAL territories) was the first major hardware revision of the PlayStation Portable, released in September 2007. The 2000 series was 33% lighter 
and 19% slimmer than the original PlayStation Portable. The capacity of the battery was also reduced by â…“, but the run time remained the same as the previous model due to lower power consumption. 
<p></P>
Older model batteries will still work, and they extend the amount of playing time. The PSP Slim & Lite has a new gloss finish. Its serial port was also modified in order to accommodate a 
new video-out feature. USB charging was also made possible. Buttons are also reportedly more responsive on the PSP-2000.
<p></P>
 In 2008, Sony released a second hardware revision called the PSP-3000 which included several features that were not present in the PSP-2000, such as a built-in microphone and upgraded 
 screen, as well as the ability to output PSP games in interlaced mode.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">PSP Go Model</h2>

Released in October 2009, the PSP Go is the biggest redesign of the PlayStation Portable to date. Unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive but instead has 16 GB 
of internal flash memory to store games, videos and other media. This can be extended by up to 32GB with the use of a Memory Stick Micro flash card.
<p></P>
Also, unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% 
lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. The screen slides up to reveal the main controls. The overall shape and sliding mechanism are similar to that of Sony's mylo COM-2 internet device.
<p></P>
The PSP Go was produced and sold concurrently with its predecessor the PSP-3000 although it did not replace it. All games on the PSP Go must be purchased and downloaded from the PlayStation 
Store as the handheld is not compatible with the original PSP's physical media, the Universal Media Disc. The handheld also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3's controllers 
the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 via Bluetooth connection.
