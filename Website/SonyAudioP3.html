<p>Wireless speakers are one of the most popular forms of portable 
   music today and Sony has taken full advantage of that. Sony has many different 
   models of bluetooth speakers ranging through each price bracket.
   As the Sony Walkman faded away with growing technological advancements, Sony 
   strived to stay on top of the market by creating some of the best high-end speakers
   that are available.
