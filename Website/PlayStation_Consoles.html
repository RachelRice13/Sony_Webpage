<h3><u>PlayStation</u></h3>
<img src="Graphics/ps1.jpg" id="playstation" title="The original PlayStation" alt="PlayStation One" style="float:right;"></img>
The PlayStation, often abbreviated as the PS1 and PSX, was the first home video game console released by Sony Computer Entertainment.
The original release of the PlayStation was on December 3, 1994, in Japan and then released worldwide the following year. 
 It used CDs to play games and competed against the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn.<br></br>
The PlayStation was the first “computer entertainment platform” to ship over 100 million units, which it had reached nine years after its initial launch. 
In July 2000, a smaller redesign version of the original PlayStation, called the PS One was released, replacing the original grey console and named 
appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.<br></br>
The initial version of the console represented a significant improvement in terms of graphic quality over the existing cartridge players of the early 1990s. 
Games encoded on CD-ROM s allowed faster loading times, improved graphical user interfaces and richer visual environments.<br></br>
The last PS one units were sold in late 2006 to early 2007 shortly after it was officially discontinued, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch
eleven years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March
2006 – over eleven years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.<br></br><br></br>
</p>

<h3><u>PlayStation 2</u></h3>
<img src="Graphics/PS2.jpg" id="playstation" title="PlayStation Two" alt="PlayStation Two" align="left"></img>
Abbreviated as PS2, the PlayStation 2 is the second generation of gaming console from Sony that was first released on March 4, 2000 in Japan and worldwide later that year. 
The console used CDs and DVDs to play games and competed against the Nintendo GameCube, Sega’s Dreamcast and Microsoft’s original Xbox.<br></br>
PS2 represented another leap in processing power and game play at its introduction with a CPU capable of 66 million polygons per second. 
PS2 also included USB ports and a modem, allowing players to play online.<br></br>
The PS2 is the best-selling video game console of all time, having sold over 155 million units worldwide, as confirmed by Sony. Over 3,800 game titles have been released for the PS2,
 with over 1.5 billion copies sold. Sony later manufactured several smaller, lighter revisions of the console known as Slimline models in 2004.<br></br>
Even with the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3, the PS2 remained popular well into the seventh generation, and continued to be produced until 2013, 
when Sony finally announced it had been discontinued after over twelve years of production – one of the longest lifespans of a video game console. 
Despite the announcement, new games for the console continued to be produced until the end of 2013, including Final Fantasy XI: Seekers of Adoulin, FIFA 13 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2014.<br></br><br></br>

<h3><u>PlayStation 3</u></h3>
<img src="Graphics/Ps3.jpg" id="playstation" title="PlayStation Three" alt="PlayStation Three" style="float:right;"></img>
The PlayStation 3 or PS 3 is the third gaming console system developed by Sony that was first released on November 11, 2006.  The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against 
Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.<br></br>
The PS 3 was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the 
PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita.<br></br>
In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original 
version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.<br></br>
During its early years, the system was negatively received, due to its high price ($599 for a 60-gigabyte model, $499 for a 20 GB model), a complex processor architecture, 
and lack of quality games but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and "untapped potential". The reception would get more positive over time. The system had a slow start in the 
market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model. Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013.<br></br>
The PlayStation 3 was first discontinued in New Zealand in 2015 and then later discontinued in Europe, Australia and North America in 2016, with it becoming completely discontinued in early 2017.<br></br><br></br>

<h3><u>PlayStation 4</u></h3>
<img src="Graphics/ps4.jpg" id="playstation" title="PlayStation Four" alt="PlayStation Four" align="left"></img>
The PlayStation 4, also called PS4, is an eighth-generation home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in 
February 2013, it was launched the following November. It’s the 4th best-selling console of all time.  Its main competitors are Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch.<br></br>
The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation 
Vita and other supported devices, the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely. The console's controller was also redesigned and 
improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video 
and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.<br></br>
<u>PlayStation 4 hardware information</u></br>
The PS4 console utilizes an AMD 64-bit APU, 8 gigabytes of GDDR5 memory, connects to the Internet through Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable, and reads Blu-ray discs for both games and 
movies. It can connect to a TV through an HDMI connection for excellent video and audio quality.<br></br>
The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development, and for not imposing 
the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. 
By the end of September 2019, over 102 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide, surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3.<br></br>
On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU 
and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.<br></br><br></br>

<h3><u>PlayStation 5</u></h3>
<img src="Graphics/ps5.jpg" id="playstation" title="PlayStation Five" alt="PlayStation Five" style="float:right;"></img>
The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is an upcoming home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 4 in 2019, its launch is scheduled for late 2020.<br></br>
In a Wired article in April 2019, Sony lead architect Mark Cerny revealed information on the then-unnamed successor to the PlayStation 4. This new console has a specialized 
solid-state drive, a custom AMD GPU capable of ray tracing, backward compatibility with most PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games, and support for both digital and disc-based games.<br></br><br></br>
