Sony offers a wide range of digital cameras. Point-and-shoot models adopt the Cyber-shot name, while digital single-lens reflex models are branded using Alpha.
The first Cyber-shot was introduced in 1996 when digital cameras were a novelty. Sony’s market share of the digital camera market fell from a high of 20% to 9% by 2005.
Sony entered the market for digital single-lens reflex cameras in 2006 when it acquired the camera business of Konica Minolta. Sony rebranded the company’s line of cameras as its Alpha line. 
Sony is the world’s third largest manufacturer of the cameras, behind Canon and Nikon respectively. There are also a variety of Camcorders which are manufactured by Sony.
